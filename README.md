# SNN-MNIST-Exploration

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository delves into the fascinating world of **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** by implementing a simple SNN model for the classic **MNIST handwritten digit classification** task. Unlike traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs operate using discrete spike events, mimicking the biological brain, which promises superior energy efficiency and processing capabilities for certain applications, especially on neuromorphic hardware.

This project specifically focuses on:
* Understanding the core concepts of SNNs, including spike encoding and spike sequences.
* Building an SNN classifier using the user-friendly `snnTorch` library, which leverages PyTorch's robust framework.
* Visualizing the dynamic behavior of SNNs, such as neuron spiking activity and membrane potentials, to gain intuitive insights.
* Demonstrating the training process of SNNs for a well-known dataset.
